# Crypto Portfolio Price Tracker HTML Widget builder

Deliverable = HTML Widget builder to embed code in a bitrix24 website.

See example attached.

Functions:
- Add new rows including same Coin bought at a different date/time/price. Example BTC bought on 1/1/2020 then another row for BTC bought on 1/1/2021.
- Sort by Column
- Quantity and Price are input fields
- Change Colour/Style of table - MS Excel style.
- Currency Selection
- Search
- Pagination
- Number of Rows

Non functional:

- Realtime updates from https://www.coingecko.com/en/api
- Widget code does not require any other dependencies other than the API. Stand alone.

See Builder Example attached and samples. Would like 2 quotes, one to do all Types and Templates in the Builder and one for just the Portfolio Type.

Looking for a quick and simple widget builder.
